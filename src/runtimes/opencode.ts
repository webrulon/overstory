 * - Uses `--model` flag for model selection
 * - Instruction file lives at `AGENTS.md` (unverified — confirm against real install)
 * - No hooks deployment (OpenCode has no Claude Code hook mechanism)
 * - `detectReady` is a stub — real TUI ready patterns not yet observed in tmux
 * - `parseTranscript` returns null — `opencode` output format not yet verified
 *
 * TODO: Once a real OpenCode installation is available:
 * 1. Verify `instructionPath` — run `opencode` and check which file it reads
 * 2. Fill in `detectReady` — capture tmux pane content and match actual strings
 * 3. Fill in `parseTranscript` — run `opencode run --format json` and inspect output
 * 4. Fill in `getTranscriptDir` — check where OpenCode writes session files
